# EXP.NO.3.-IMPLEMENTATION-OF-DELTA-MODULATION

# AIM
To study the Delta modulation using the Delta Modulation trainer kit.

# APPARATUS REQUIRED
Trainer Kit, DSO(10MHz) , Patch Cords and Power Supply (0-30V)

# PROCEDURE
1.Power ON the Trainer Kit Switch on the Delta Modulation Trainer Kit and ensure all necessary modules are functional.

2.Connect the Input Signal Connect the function generator to the input terminal of the trainer kit. Set the generator to output a low-frequency sine wave (e.g., 1 kHz, 1 Vpp).

3.Connect Output to CRO Use BNC cables to connect the modulated output from the kit to Channel 1 of the CRO. Connect the demodulated (reconstructed) output to Channel 2 of the CRO.

4.Observe Modulated Signal On the oscilloscope, observe the digital Delta Modulated waveform. It should appear as a staircase or two-level binary waveform.

5.Observe Demodulated Signal Now observe the demodulated output waveform on the second channel. Compare it to the input waveform from the function generator.

6.Adjust Parameters Vary the sampling rate and input frequency. Observe how the output waveforms change. Too high an input frequency or too low a sampling rate may lead to slope overload distortion.

7.Record Observations Note down the waveforms seen on the CRO for different configurations. Take screenshots or sketch the waveforms for report purposes.
